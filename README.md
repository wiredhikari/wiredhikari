### Greetings!
I'm Atharva (aka wiredhikari), a third year undergraduate student in IIT Kgp, India. based from Pune. I do open source for fun. I love linux and am currently exploring Blockchain and playing with Rust. I play chess and love to read economics and psychology. I don't write often but you can find me [here](https://atharva.io/). Ok, I hate web development and javascript so much that i am writing it here. You can reach me out on  atharvaamritkar@protonmail.com.
